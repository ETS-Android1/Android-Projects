My android application projects.  

## Introduction of Gallery  
A photo viewer app that uses Pixabay(a website provides free photos)'s API. The basic functions includes:
* Search for the photos based on your input 
  * You can use Space between several different words(eg."cat dog") to include several information you want to search for.
* When you taped the photo, the link of that photo will appear and then you can copy it for searching the information about that photo if you want.
* You can use Refresh to get some new photos based on your input
* You can rotate your screen

### The motivation of making this app
To learn the method of using Internet to achieve some functions in a application.
